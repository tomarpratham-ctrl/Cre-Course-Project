Developed a kinetic and thermal model for catalytic reforming of naphtha in a plug flow reactor (PFR). Implemented mass balance, energy balance, and catalyst decay equations and solved using MATLABâ€™s ode45. Achieved 85% paraffin conversion with 60% aromatic yield, aligning with industrial reforming performance.
